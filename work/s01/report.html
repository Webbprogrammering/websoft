<b>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</b>
<p>
    Git and GitHub is something we have worked with many times before, starting from the first year. Overall I feel like
    I got the basics of it down, and I would be comfortable with doing anything this course requires me to do using
    those technologies.
    <br>
    Markdown however is something that I have never used before and is therefore a whole new concept for me. I am not
    familiar with what is possible to be done with it nor am I familiar with the syntax of it.
    <br>
    GitHub pages is also a new concept for me, but it turned out to be fairly straightforward to setup which was a
    pleasant surprise.
</p>
<b>Have you ever created websites before?</b>
<p>
    No, I have zero experience in creating websites. None of the courses we have taken so far required us to do so
    and I have never had a personal interest for such a thing.
</p>
<b>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</b>
<p>
    No experience with it whatsoever. I only understand the very basics of it and I have never tried to learn more
    myself. This is going to be the first time ever venturing into this field and I hope it can be interesting and not
    as tedious as many people that I have talked to about it have made it seem like.
</p>
<b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
<p>
    I have learned how links work and how we can jump from one html file to another. I have also learned about how
    GitHub pages make it easy to launch a simple website out there without having to do anything else about it which
    honestly seems pretty cool as well.
