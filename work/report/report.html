        <h2>S01</h2>
        <p>
            Git and GitHub is something we have worked with many times before, starting from the first year. Overall I feel like
            I got the basics of it down. I would most likely be comfortable with doing most of what this course requires me to
            do using those technologies.
            <br>
            Markdown however is something that I have never used before and is therefore a whole new concept for me. I am not
            familiar with what is possible to be done with it nor am I familiar with the syntax of it.
            <br>
            GitHub pages is also a new concept for me. Luckily, it turned out to be fairly straightforward to setup which was a
            pleasant surprise.
        </p>
        <b>Have you ever created websites before?</b>
        <p>
            No, I have zero experience in creating websites. None of the courses we have taken so far required us to do so,
            until now. I have never had a personal interest for such a thing due to being more interested in other topics
            instead.
        </p>
        <b>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</b>
        <p>
            No experience with it whatsoever. I only understand the very basics of it and I have never tried to learn more
            myself. This is going to be the first time ever venturing into this field. I hope it can be interesting and not as
            tedious as many people that I have talked to about it have made it seem like.
        </p>
        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
        <p>
            I have learned how links work and how we can jump from one html file to another. I have also learned about how
            GitHub pages work. They make it so easy to launch a simple website out there without having to do anything else
            about it which honestly seems pretty cool as well.
        </p>

        <h2>S02</h2>
        <b>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</b>
        <p>
            I have seen some HTML code before, but had not written it myself. I am kind of familiar with the logic
            behind it however. That is because it feels very similar to how xml code might look like, which I have used
            extensively when working with Android.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS is something that I have in fact used before. It was during a project on JavaFX. On that platform, CSS
            can be used to style the application. Despite that fact, I only used to make simple changes, like colors and
            at best showing a different color when something is hovered. I do understand however that a ton of things
            can be customised through CSS, and there is plenty of room for improvement with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is something that unfortunately I have not used before. I do understand however that it is a very
            popular programming language used by a big percentage of the programmers worldwide. Due to that fact, I
            would be very interested in learning more about it through this course. This is in fact my main goal for
            this course.
        </p>
        <b>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b>
        <p>
            Those three languages combined are used to present the information to the user through HTML, style the user
            interface through CSS and finally make the website dynamic with the use of JavaScript.
        </p>
        <b>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</b>
        <p>
            The browser's work is to load the necessary files, render them for the user and allow for user interaction.
            Through the HTTP protocol it is able to ask for those files from remote servers, and download the files that
            as mentioned before are rendered for the user. These files include the HTML, the CSS and even the JavaScript
            files that the website consists of.
        </p>
        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
        <p>
            In this part, the most interesting concept was learning how the whole stack of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
            interact with each other. The rest of the concepts discussed in this section were something that I was more
            familiar with. However this part was not something that I had done myself before. It seems to be much more
            simple than what I had in my mind.
