        My name is Stylianos Gakis, born and raised in Pentavrysos, Kastoria at northwest Greece. I used to play
        football and was always interested in computers basically just because of computer games. Dota, Lineage II,
        Call of Duty 2, Unreal Tournament 3, Warcraft III etc.

        Programming was something that I got first introduced to when I was approximately 17, however my first real
        experience was in this school, where Andreas made sure I really fell in love with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hobbies include simply going to the gym. School should also be included as well however, as it has been really
        fun with all the projects we have worked on. It is what I spend most of my time on.

        Looking forward to learning more about web development and JavaScript in particular through this course.
