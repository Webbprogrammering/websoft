<h2>S01</h2>
<p>TIL - John Daley jan 21, 2020.

    I have been using git for the duration of my time at university, sometimes rather poorly. 
    Because of this I knew a most of the basics inside of git and terminal, that being said, I had never
    used ssh and git hub. Because I have two factor authentication set up on my github, I was forced to learn to ssh
    into my git account instead of using my normal user name and password combination. I learned this in the best way possible
    , failing over and over while googling! In a shortened version I learned that to use ssh with git hub
    a user must first generate a new ssh key on their local machine, this can be done from terminal in linux, after that 
    a user must add said key to there github profile. after which the user must be sure to switch from a https
    origin to a the ssh origin, where I had issues with this because my clone was based on the https link. Because of this
    the all origins must be deleted and then set up again to contain the correct origin link. 
    after doing this I was able to continue as normal with the git. I also learned about version tagging which was a small
    but useful skill to have, considering I, with luck, will start working in just a few months as a consultant. I also 
    learned about git pages and have been fighting with it for a day. </p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Do I have any previous experience with html/css/js - Not much, some basic html and css in a komvux course I took! 
   What role does Html/css/js have - Html is like the frame of a house, Css is like the painting and furnishing and JS is that the fan turns on when you press the power button! 
   browser-http-webserver interaction - The browser takes a url then sends a http request to the server to obtain the required data for that
